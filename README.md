## What is this?

Configuration files of various user applications like `zsh` `git` `vim`, and `zed`, on my major MacBook. All of them follows [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory). What you're seeing is my `$HOME` directory with other folders and files ignored.

What you might want to see is [.config/zsh/.zshrc](/BigCoke233/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/zsh/.zshrc), which contains:

- How I implement XDG Specification
- Aliases I use very often (custom commands like `peek` and `mkcd`)
- How I set up proxies and stuff

Many of the rest are default settings. I plan on customizing them in the future.
